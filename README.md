# ReactTestCode
This is the first piece of ReactJS code I wrote.  It was a interview tech assessment

The problem

Your task is to implement a very minimal version of the outbox using React with the following features:

The user can add and delete rows
Each row has a text field for an email address and a drop-down field with a list of merit titles to choose from.
The user can select rows to “send”, which can consist of just console.logging “Sent email to ______” and removing the row
Rows should stay in place when the user refreshes the page (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API may be useful here)
